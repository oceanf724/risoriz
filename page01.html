<h1> History of Riso</h1>

        <a>Riso is the name of both a printer and ink company in Japan. Company founder Noboru Hayama started his company in post-war Japan in 1946, and named it RISO, which is Japanese for “ideal”. His reasoning behind choosing this name was because he saw it was important that people should not lose their ideals during periods of despair. RISO had originally started as a printer company. However, due to the lack of available mimeograph ink, Hayama started developing his own ink to use. And after 18 months, he had successfully developed Japan’s first emulsion ink which you may know as RISO Ink.

        <a>Between 1975 to 1988, RISO created a series of fundamentally unique products for the home and the office. In 1977, RISO introduced the PRINT GOCCO model, which was meant for home use. This product became very popular soon after its release and by the end of the year had the sales had gone through the roof. RISO also developed the RISOGRAPH, an all-new printing system for the office based on its original duplicating technology. It continued to lead the field from its debut in 1980. In 1984, RISO released the RISOGRAPH 007, which integrates all functions required for mastermaking and printing into a single unit. This product created a stir at the time and was dubbed as a "printing robot", capable of realizing large-volume print jobs at high speed and low running cost while being easy to use.
